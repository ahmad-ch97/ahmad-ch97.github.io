            I'm a mechanical and design engineer. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn from
            experianced professionals and work alongside them.
          </p>
          <p class="intro ma">I have graduated with a bachelorâ€™s in mechanical engineering from the New York Institute of Technology. My passion for designing products sparked at an early age when I started developing my own products to solve the problems I experienced in everyday life. My deep interest led me to delve into how each device functions by conducting experiments. This passion drove me to spend most of my days researching, optimizing, and testing new product concepts. I taught myself the basics of how a product is manufactured in order to be able to make my ideas reality.</p>
