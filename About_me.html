          I enjoy making stuff and have been doing it since I was a kid. As a
          maker, my projects start from scratch, either with a piece of wood,
          metal, plastic, or leather. Each project teaches me a lot and
          stretches the bounds of my knowledge. I make a lot of mistakes but
          they serve as excellent teacher. My ultimate plan is to open up a
          workshop and make things for a living.

        <p class="text1">
          I develop products to enhance my everyday life and develop equipment
          to ease my production process. My eagerness in becoming a professional
          in creating products led me to delve into how different devices
          function by conducting experiments and devising numerous projects. 3d
          printing and woodworking are few of the methods I taught myself to
          make my ideas into reality.
