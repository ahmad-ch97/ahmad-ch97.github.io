      <h2>EVALUATION OF AN F1 CAR REAR WING</h2>
      <div>
        <p class="abstract1">
          F1 cars largely depend on downforce to achieve very high speeds on
          corners. Finding the balance between drag and downforce is what every
          formula 1 team is trying to accomplish. Since the rear wing greatly
          contribute to the total downforce on F1 cars, this study focused on
          improving the F1 rear wing and flap. Numerous designs were created to
          discover the best rear wing characteristics to generate the highest
          downforce possible while keeping the drag at a manageable value. The
          first finding of the study was that the rear wing function better with
          a decent distance between the wing and the flap. Placing the flap very
          close to the wing decreases the downforce and result in a distorted
          flow. This research found out that 4cm gap between the wing and the
          flap yields the best results in terms of downforce and drag. The
          second discovery of the study is at what angle of attack the wing and
          flap should be positioned. It was revealed that as the angle of attack
          increase, the downforce and drag increase as well. An airfoil with a
          high curvature can go up to 20 degrees while still generating high
          downforce. But an airfoil with low curvature stall earlier and start
          declining in downforce as the angle reach 15 degrees. The purpose of
          using multi-element wings is that the wing can assist the flap in
          adhering the flow to the surface. Thus, the flap is able to produce
          downforce at very high angles of attack. Once the flap angle is
          changed independently, the downforce peaked. After analysing multiple
          designs, this study discovered that GOE 233 airfoil with 4cm gab
          between the wing whose angle is at 10 degrees and the flap whose angle
          is at 28 degrees produced the highest downforce with relatively low
          drag. The addition of the gurney flap to the system resulted in higher
          downforce production, but higher drag as well. The increase in drag
          was around 33%, which makes the gurney flap used only in specific
          situation where straight line speed is not significant.

        INFLUENCE OF WRAP ANGLES AND ANGLES OF TWIST ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THE
        CENTRIFUGAL PUMP
      </h2>
      <div>
        <p class="abstract1">
          Centrifugal pumps are used extensively in the oil and gas industry,
          construction sector and wastewater infrastructure. The impeller is
          considered as the most vital component that contributes to the
          efficiency of the pump. The design of the impeller consists of
          independent parameters which have an impact on the pump. Implementing
          changes to the geometrical parameters of the impeller can aid in
          improving pump performance and result in saving a significant amount
          of money on energy costs. This research investigates the pump
          characteristics by modifying the wrap angles and the angles of twist
          by making variations to the angle at the inlet and outlet,
          respectively. Numerical simulations have been carried out on ANSYS.
          Navier-Stokes equations with realizable k-ε turbulence model were used
          for the unsteady and incompressible flow of water through the pump.
          Firstly, the pressure and velocity contours were attained for the wrap
          angles 90˚, 120˚, 140˚,150 ˚, 160 ˚ and 180˚. Following that, the most
          efficient wrap angle was combined with different variations in inlet
          and outlet angles. The investigations showed that the wrap angles and
          angles of twist have a significant influence on the performance of the
          pump. The highest head was achieved with a wrap angle of 120˚ and an
          inlet angle of 20˚ and an outlet angle of 25˚. Lastly, Finite Element
          Analysis was performed to determine the Von misses stress distribution
          across the blade and to ensure there's a safe margin to prevent any
          distortion from occurring.

      <h2>OPTIMIZATIO OF A STEAM POWER PLANT</h2>
      <p class="abstract1">
        Steam engines need to be optimized to meet the world's increasing global
        demands for electricity. A coal-fired steam engine operates on the basis
        on a Rankine cycle. The purpose of this research is to investigate the
        effect of different conditions on the efficiency of steam power plants.
        Five different cases were studied that consisted of a combination of
        reheaters and implementation of feedwaters into the cycle. The results
        obtained indicated that efficiency was the highest for a system with
        double reheater with one closed feedwater and one open feedwater.
